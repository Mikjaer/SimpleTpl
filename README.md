    of a given function should not be dictated by it' parameters
    but by the functionname itself.

 A: Download example.php, example.tpl and SimpleTpl.class.php and
    read the code, play around with it, it's pretty self-explanatory.

    a different license under my choosing. If you want this software under another license, please contact me.
